    Particle Filter Localization.

    This class implements basic plotting and logging functionality for the Particle Filter,
    as well as the interface for the child classes to implement.

    A particle filter is a Monte Carlo algorithm that approximates the posterior distribution of the robot
    by a set of weighted particles.  Note that the "weight" (which is a terrible term) is simply the 
    probability of the particle being correct. Therefore, each particle is an estimate, and each estimate 
    has some probability of being correct.
